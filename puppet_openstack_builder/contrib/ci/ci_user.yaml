# These are user config options that are needed to work with the heat

# additions to this file changing other aspects of the install, but
# if you change any of the options below, the cluster may not

# Heat will use one pre-existing network with external routing
# (eth0) to deploy using puppet and create two internal networks

# The following is a hack to avoid cyclic dependencies in heat.
# The nodes will have /etc/hosts entries for the nodes that they
# depend on, but the first node at the top of the tree is the
# build server, which needs to contain the controller IP when
# deploying normally. To avoid this, we set all normal instances
# of the controller_ip to be the hostname, which compute and control
# nodes will have in /etc/hosts, and set the bind address for
# mysql and postgres to be open. There is also an unused host
# resource in the coi::base module which we give dummy values.
